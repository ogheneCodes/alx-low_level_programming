								Notes
							------------------

1. Structures: A structure is a user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.

2. struct: A struct in the C programming language (and many derivatives) is a composite data type (or record) declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name which returns the same address. 

3. Data structures: Besides functions you can also write documentation for structs, unions, enums and typedefs. Instead of the function name you must write the name of the declaration;

4. typedef: The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type, a new name.
